## Running the App

To run the development server locally:

1. Install dependencies (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to the URL shown in the terminal (usually http://localhost:5173).

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
